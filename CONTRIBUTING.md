# Contributing to TilePix
:tada: First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Atom and its packages, which are hosted in the 
[TilePix repository](https://github.com/bcvery1/tilepix) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your
best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bcvery1/tilepix/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected
to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to @bcvery1.

## How can I contribute?

### Report bugs
Find problem in the package and raise an [issue](https://github.com/bcvery1/tilepix/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).

Please use the template provided.

### Suggest features
If you have a good idea for a feature (no matter how large or small) create an [issue](https://github.com/bcvery1/tilepix/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### Create a pull request
Please ensure that before you create an issue.  Pull requests without previously raised issues will be rejected.

When creating a pull request, please add yourself to the contributors file (if you're not already in there).

There is a [coding standard](https://github.com/bcvery1/tilepix/blob/master/CODING_STANDARD.md) which is a requirement
for all pull requests.

#### Add tests
Additional tests, when they are meaningful, are a really useful contribution, and a good first issue.

#### Add examples
Example projects are a fantastic way for new-comers to learn how to use the package.  If the examples are clear enough
they may make their way into the wiki!
